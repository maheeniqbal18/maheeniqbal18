**Studying UX at ASU and designing seamless interactions by the day, and enjoying sitcoms by night.**

I am a UXer living the rainy but beautiful city of Seattle. Born and raised in Pakistan, I moved to the US two years ago. Now, as a true PNW girl, you'll find me in my hiking boots, planning my next trip to the Rainier. :volcano:

Before joining the User Experience program at ASU, I worked as a curriculum designer. Creating interactive and engaging materials with a focus on making learning fun for kids inspired my shift into the field of UX.

In addition to creating user-centric products, I am also currently developing my coding skills, which I believe will further enhance my ability to design effective user experiences.
